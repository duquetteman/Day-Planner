# Unit 05 Third-Party APIs Homework: Day Planner

This simple calendar application shows the current day and allows the user to save events for each hour of a normal business day (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).  The time blocks update their color based on what time of day it is.  

This app takes advantage of the Moment.JS API for date functions and the browsers local storage for storing all the input values, as well as JQuery for JavaScript functionality and Bootstrap for styling.
